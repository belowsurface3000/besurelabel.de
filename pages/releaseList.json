On expeditions throughout East Asia, Below Surface discovered ShanShui, a traditional Chinese style of painting which represents a steady and peaceful drawn image of landscape, often mountains that nonetheless provide an idea of immense restrained power. Eleven track album Below Surface is the massive outcome of elapsed time and applied potential, containing strong drums and basslines, partially paired with smoother sounds from synthesizers and field-recorders. Summed up: Unobtrusive but steady and powerful, like a mountain covered in fog.",
